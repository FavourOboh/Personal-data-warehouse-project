======================================================================
These were various steps i took to make sure the tables were cleaned up
 enough to move to the silver table. I altered the tables that had a lot
 of decimals and finally moved the clean tables to the silver table.
======================================================================

--Check for nulls or duplicates in the primary key
---Expectation: No result


SELECT
order_id,
COUNT(*)
FROM bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 OR order_id IS NULL

--check fow unwanted spaces
--Expectation : no result
SELECT 
customer_segment
FROM bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]
WHERE customer_segment != TRIM(customer_segment)

---Altering table 
ALTER TABLE  bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]
ALTER COLUMN discount_applied INT;

-- BADdata check
SELECT discount_applied
FROM  bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]
WHERE TRY_CAST (discount_applied AS INT) IS NULL

---Rounding up
SELECT
 total_amount,
 ROUND(total_amount,2) AS total_amount
FROM bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]

--check if decimals are supported properly
SELECT DATA_TYPE
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]' 
AND COLUMN_NAME = 'total_amount';

--Alter tables
ALTER TABLE bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]
ALTER COLUMN total_amount
DECIMAL(12,2);

ALTER TABLE bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]
ALTER COLUMN net_amount
DECIMAL(12,2);

ALTER TABLE bronze.[ecm_ecommerce_dataset.csv]
ALTER COLUMN unit_price
DECIMAL(12,2);
